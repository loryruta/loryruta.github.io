        <div class="row introduction">
            <div class="col">
                <p>
                    I'm <b>Lorenzo Rutayisire</b> — probably better known online as <b>loryruta</b> — and I'm a student at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy),
                    where I've graduated in Computer Engineering and where I'm currently attending "Artificial Intelligence - Large Scale".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I consider myself a Software developer in the most general sense of the term, as in my career I've been involved in projects of several kinds (both for work, hobby or university tasks):
                    from embedded programming to web development. Sometimes I've also been involved in web design tasks and I can clearly say <b><u>I'm not a web designer</u></b>
                    (use this page as a proof)!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My area of interest, so far 5 years since now, is Computer Graphics and in general GPU programming. During these years I've studied and experimented several graphics APIs (OpenGL and Vulkan),
                    and rendering techniques that have been useful in my hobby projects (that if you're interested you can check out on my Github profile). Also, my Bachelor degree thesis was about the architectural
                    design of a Vulkan renderer and implementation of real-time Computer Graphics techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I'm an electronics enthusiast — I really like sparks but I'm not that brave to make them by myself — and I enjoy everything that's mind-blowing regarding mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy playing guitar and piano, and <b><u>go outside</u></b> to practice calisthenics and acrobatics &#x1F642;
                </p>

                    vren is a 3D graphics library written over the Vulkan API. It provides different levels of abstraction: the library itself
                    is a set of modules that the user can combine to achieve several tasks and possibly enable optimization techniques according
                    to its hardware capabilities. At the moment the main features are <b>Mesh-Shading rendering</b>, <b>Occlusion Culling</b> and
                    <b>Clustered Shading</b>.

                    mdmc was thought to be a tool capable of converting a 3D model into a Minecraft schematic (a subset of the Minecraft world). The process
                    consists in the conversion of the 3D model to a 3D volume (<b>conservative rasterization</b>) and then the mapping of the 3D volume into Minecraft blocks.
                    The tool hasn't been completed due to difficulties in the mapping process, but features interesting techniques such as <b>parallel RadixSort</b>,
                    <b>parallel Octree construction</b> and <b>traversal</b> for visualization.

                    Openverse is a sandbox voxel-world game written in Java (not to say it's yet another Minecraft clone). Its architecture is very similar to Minecraft's: the codebase is
                    splitted in a client and a server, that cooperate locally to achieve singleplayer modality and can be detached for multiplayer. Openverse is thought to be easily and
                    totally moddable by a future community (that's why we chose Java). For graphics, it uses LWJGL — which is a Java-port of OpenGL — and features a rasterize-based renderer
                    and SSAO as an optional post-processing effect.
